# Assignment-Git-GitHub-
An explanation of Git &amp; GitHub in my POV. 

**Git** is just a tool used to keep track of changes in code over time, collaborating and sharing. 

**GitHub** is just a website or software of _Git_ with a more readable user-interface.

_**What is a Respository?**_ for me i would say a respository is a piece memory or space used to store data( <sup>Project files</sup> ), a history of changes are documented and kept. 

*Cloning*
	-This is a duplication of a file with an intension of making it local, so that it can be used easily e.g in a code 
editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Branches and forks
while both of these terms seem to mean the ~~same~~, they are different. 
#### Branches
	Branches like the name suggests, its when a group of people( _Colleagues or friends_ ) work together on a certain project but divide the work in smaller pieces to make progress. once all are done its merged together. 
#### Forking
	This is mostly done as individuals, because before you make changes in someones project our ideas or work will be previewed and be tested before being merged witb the original. 
### Committing and pushing
This refers to the process of updating a certain project after making some changes or after adding new information that might help the project. 

**Issues and profile** These two are Self-explanatory. 

**Markdown** is the [CSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) of github, it is the process of;

1.Formatting paragraphs. 

2.Styling of texts and fonts. 

3.Adding links, colours, pictures, etc. 

 ***GitHub a social platform*** GitHub also has similar features of a social media( e.g *Facebook*, *Instagram*), because you can like someone's project this is called starring, you can create and follow a profile and many more. 

## Challenges encountered 
Some of the *markdown* features where not working for me. 

i failed to understand what *pull request* mean or maybe i just confused it with *forking*

just need to go through it once more maybe also watch some videos on YouTube then i will understand it fully. 

<!-- Am ready for the critics XD -->
